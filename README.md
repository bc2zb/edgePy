# edgePy

Differential expression analysis. This project should import, filter, and manage count data. 

EdgeR is a package for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological replication. It implements a range of statistical methodology based on the negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be applied to differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce counts, including ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and CAGE.
